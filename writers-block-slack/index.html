      <p>So I counted just now, and apparently I've written about 15,000 words in the last three weeks. About 1/3 of a novel, going by the <a href="">Nanowrimo</a> convention.</p>

<p>To clarify: I'm not doing Nanowrimo, this happened mostly by accident, and it is not normal for me to write so much. Writing is generally hard for me, but these 15,000 words were easy. I'm actually pretty giddy about it.</p>

<p>To back up: like most of my peers, I've had A Blogging Goal since forever. It's an accepted truism in Silicon Valley that everyone who wants to be anyone should write – that even if it took you 20 years to get good and build up an audience, a good blog is so valuable that you ought to start right away. And like most people who want to write, I struggle.</p>

<p>I've been told I'm a good writer, actually. When I worked at Meteor, I wrote a lot for the blog and mailing list. One of my early posts – <a href="">Why web beginners should start with Meteor</a> – was [bragging statistic], and apparently inspired people to do drastic things like <a href="">quit their job to learn to code</a>. Back in college, I wrote some <a href="">fanfiction</a>, one of which has 154 reviews saying things like ["example"]. To this day, [X years later], I still get about one email notification a day saying someone has left me "kudos" on one of my stories.</p>

<p>The problem is: getting myself to write has historically been a laborious process involving a lot of procrastination, self-flagellation, accountability systems, locking myself in rooms, turning off WiFi and putting phones on airplane mode, pomodoros, goal-alignment meditation, and all kinds of other willpower-consuming attempts to impose discipline onto a brain that dives headlong toward the nearest source of internet fuckery and self-distraction whenever I ask it: "….sooo, shall we write today?" Even when it was my full-time job to write for Meteor, it took so much effort and willpower to have a good writing day, that I could only manage it about once a week, maybe two or three times if I was feeling cheerful and getting plenty of sleep and one of the posts was allowed to be formulaic.</p>

<p>My main problem is in the rough-drafting phase, the "don't think, just write" early bit that is critical if you want to be prolific, and not just good. I have premature editing syndrome like it's a disease.</p>

<p>So whence these 15,000 words in 3 weeks?</p>

<h2 id="the-thingy-in-a-nutshell">The thingy in a nutshell</h2>

<p>Here it is: <strong>Do your rough drafting in a <a href="">Slack</a> chat channel instead of in a document.</strong></p>

<p>That's it. It sounds a bit too-simple and anticlimatic when written down, but "I accidentally 15,000 words" crosses the threshhold where perhaps I'm On To Something and should share it anyway.</p>

<p>My personal slack channel wasn't originally conceived of as a writing aid – I figured I would mostly use it as a place to write down my goals for the day, in a place where my roommates could see them and hold me accountable. Or as an inbox for interesting links and random todos that wandered across my attention. But it's turned out to be the perfect place to ramble stream-of-consciousness style about whatever I'm thinking about, which is what good rough-drafting is all about.</p>

<h2 id="the-how-to">The how-to</h2>

<p>1) <strong>Set up a Slack organization with a few trusted friends.</strong> These should be people that you like and find easy to talk to, people with whom you feel safe sharing half-baked thoughts. In my case, my roommates and I already had a house Slack organization. We had set it up back when we moved in together, just to chat and banter and keep on the same page about house things.</p>

<p>2) <strong>Create a personal channel and add your friends to it.</strong> I created a personal channel called #alice-, with its channel purpose set to: "Alice talks to herself, and maybe to you!"</p>

<p>3) <strong>Write liberally about whatever's on your mind.</strong> Think out loud. Ramble. Keep it casual – you're just talking to yourself, after all. Your friends can read along (if they want to) at their own pace. And not everything you write has to be Deep Thoughts and Future Blog Posts. Funny incidents and pictures from your day are A-OK too. Just share what's going on with you.</p>

<p>4) <strong>Copy-paste the interesting stuff for editing.</strong> Now and then, something interesting and potentially blog-shaped will emerge from your ramblings. Now is the part where you're allowed to move your words into a document and do some editing.</p>

<h2 id="why-it-seems-to-work">Why it seems to work</h2>

<p>Email and chat are so ubiquitious in our lives – so frequently and casually used – that it probably doesn't even feel like writing to you. It's more like talking. You're just having a conversation with a person on the other side. Words flow so much more readily when you're looking at a chat input box or a Gmail compose window, compared to staring at a blank paper or text editor. It somehow bypasses the part of your brain that makes "just writing" hard.</p>

<p>With chat in particular, the medium encourages you to write just a sentence or two at a time, and it prevents you from easily going back and editing the previous line. Once you've hit enter, the focus jumps to the next bit of thought. And unlike a text editor, a chat client feels like it's listening. There's a quiet expectancy to the blank input line. You're in the middle of a long train of thought, and you don't want to leave your imaginary listener hanging for too long with only <em>"Alice is typing"</em> to look at. So you get to your point, and resist stalling for the perfect words, and keep the momentum moving forward. Perfect rough-drafting form, in other words.</p>

<h2 id="why-slack-in-particular">Why Slack in particular?</h2>

<p>There are a lot of chat clients out there, but I think Slack is particularly well suited for writing out long-form thoughts in chat form. For a few reasons:</p>

<p>1) <strong>Multiple independent channels.</strong> Slack makes it easy to create any number of channels (i.e. chat rooms), each with its own purpose. I can write as much as I want in #alice- channel without getting in the way of other things my roommates might want to talk about.</p>

<p>2) <strong>No unnecesssary notifications.</strong> Imagine writing a long essay a sentence at a time over Facebook messenger or Gchat. Your friend's phone would be going off every few seconds for a long time, whereas Slack doesn't ping people unless they've been explicitly mentioned in a message. When you write new stuff in your Slack channel, your channel's followers will simply see that your channel has unread messages, the next time they open Slack.</p>

<p>3) <strong>Good for both conversations and monologues.</strong> Perhaps THE great thing about Slack is that it's good for having a back-and-forth in real time, but it's <em>also</em> great for writing a bunch of stuff and then having other people read it later. Slack makes it easy for people to find where they left off and catch up, or react in realtime if they happen to be on when you are.</p>

<p>4) <strong>Nice mobile version.</strong> Perhaps half the writing I've done in #alice- has been on my phone. I can write in my channel immediately any time I have an interesting thought, then later I can easily copy-paste from the Slack desktop app for editing.</p>

<p>thank you all for being my little rubber ducks :simple_smile: there's a kind of quiet, passive-listening quality to slack, that makes it really easy to talk</p>

<p>the channel purpose says "Alice talks to herself, and maybe to you!" it really does feel like that</p>

<p>"Alice talks to herself"… there's a kind of safe privacy here, like talking to your secret diary</p>

<p>"and maybe to you!"… but a kind of pointfulness and purpose that a diary lacks</p>

<p>It's not a Blog Post, or a thing to be Published – it's just me putting some thoughts down.</p>

<h2 id="so-everything-is-easy-now-right">So everything is easy now, right?!</h2>

<p>This seems like a super cool hack. The writing itself is the most important part when you're getting started – more important than the medium or platform. If you find you write more easily in the form of chats or emails, you should take full advantage of that, and give yourself permission to feel good about drafting that takes place in this context. It's "real" writing. It counts. And if it something interesting happens to come out of your chat ramblings, you can always package it up into a "proper" blog post later. And the point there is merely to make your thoughts easier to share outside of your small, trusted Slack audience.</p>

<p>Once you have the thoughts in words, however rough, the rest is relatively easy</p>

<p>anyway, inspired by this phenomenon, I registered alicedash.com just now</p>

<p>a place to put my thoughts and writings in a more accessible format, when something interesting comes out of #alice- or similar</p>

<p>and named after this channel, to embody the spirit of ease and informality and flow that I experience here</p>

<p>anyway, I'd like to have a blog up at alicedash.com by end of Friday</p>

<p>please do hold me to that :simple_smile</p>

<p>I woke up super early with my mind excitedly racing; couldn't fall back asleep</p>

<p>decided to get up and do something with my energy, after trying unsuccessfully to go back to sleep for an hour</p>

<p>so, like aray and joannabresee, I have a blogging goal</p>

<p>I find it super easy to put my thoughts down when I'm typing in this channel</p>

<p>I generally consider myself to be a pretty good writer, but I have difficulty finishing drafts sometimes, and I'm not always good at "just writing" without overediting</p>

<p>at least when it comes to Blog Posts</p>

<p>things to be Published</p>

<p>but I've found that when I'm writing in the context of a chat, or an email, it somehow bypasses the part of my brain that makes "just writing" hard</p>

<p>I still edit, sometimes quite extensively (if it's an email)</p>

<p>but the words just flow when I'm staring at a chat box or gmail compose window, instead of a blank text editor</p>

<p>this seems like a super cool hack. I think the writing itself is the most important part, more important than the medium or platform</p>

<p>so if I write more easily in chat or emails, I should take advantage of that, and allow myself to view this sort of writing as "real" writing, and feel good about it</p>

<p>and if something interesting comes out, I can always package it up into a "proper" blog post if I want.</p>

<p>once you have the thoughts in words, however rough, the rest is relatively easy</p>

<p>I used to write fairly regularly on the CFAR alumni mailing list, and sometimes people would really like something I wrote and urge me to put it up somewhere so they could more easily share it with friends</p>

<p>btw, I really like what Joanna has done, publishing pieces of writing just as Facebook posts</p>

<p>I think that's very much in the same spirit</p>

<p>anyway, inspired by this phenomenon, I registered alicedash.com just now</p>
