    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently picked up a new writing technique, and while it's too early to say, I think it might change my life. I wasn't trying to create a writing habit per se, when I started doing this Thing. Yet somewhat by accident, I find that I've written about 15,000 words in the last 3 weeks. About 1/3 of a novel, going by the Nanowrimo convention. (And, no, I'm actually not doing Nanowrimo, or writing fiction currently. It's a total coincidence that I'm writing this post in November.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, "I accidentally 15,000 words" crosses the threshhold where perhaps I am On To Something and should share the thing that has caused me to write so much, even if it sounds kind of too-simple and anticlimatic when you put it into words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hack is thus: &lt;em&gt;Write rough drafts in a Slack chat channel instead of in a document.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In slightly more words:
1) &lt;em&gt;Set up a Slack organization with a few trusted friends.&lt;/em&gt; These should be people that you like and find easy to talk to, people with whom you feel safe sharing half-baked thoughts. In my case, my roommates and I happened to have a house Slack organization. We had set it up back when we moved in together, just to chat and banter and keep on the same page about house things. 
2) &lt;em&gt;Create a personal channel and invite your friends.&lt;/em&gt; My personal channel is called #alice-, and its channel purpose is: "Alice talks to herself, and maybe to you!" 
3) &lt;em&gt;Write liberally about whatever's on your mind.&lt;/em&gt; Feel free to ramble. This space is all yours; you can write as much as you want without imposing on anyone, and other people can read it (if they want to) at their own pace. Keep it casual – you're just talking to yourself, after all. And not everything you write has to be Deep Thoughts and Future Blog Posts. Funny pictures from your day are A-OK too. Just share what's going on with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="why-it-seems-to-work"&gt;Why it seems to work&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many aspiring writers, I've struggled a lot with the "don't think, just write" rough-drafting phase, especially&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="why-slack-in-particular"&gt;Why Slack in particular?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[I've picked up a new writing habit recently][like many aspiring writers, I struggle with the "don't think just write" rough-drafting phase of writing, especially the getting started part][once I've begun putting thoughts into words and have a decent number of words in my text editor, it gets a lot easier, and I can sometimes even get into a flow and enjoy myself][editing is still a lot of work, and not always easy, but producing rough drafts is definitely where I've tended to bottleneck]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[but with this new hack, my raw words-per-day has skyrocketed and for the first time, I'm finding myself bottlenecked on editing/publishing instead of drafting] I've written about 15,000 words in the last 3 weeks, and it wasn't even hard. I never explicitly decided that I would dedicate X hours a day to it, or produce X words a day.][I never forced myself to draft.][I just changed my drafting format, and the words started to flow]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[so as not to bury the lede, here's how to set up the "hack" I've been using. I'll explain later.]
1) &lt;em&gt;Set up a slack organization with a few trusted friends.&lt;/em&gt; These should be people that you enjoy talking with and with whom you feel safe sharing half-baked thoughts. In my case, I already had a slack organization that I shared with my housemates. 
2) Create a personal channel, probably named after yourself.
3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The background&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why it seems to work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why Slack in particular?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up super early with my mind excitedly racing; couldn't fall back asleep&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;decided to get up and do something with my energy, after trying unsuccessfully to go back to sleep for an hour&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so, like aray and joannabresee, I have a blogging goal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it super easy to put my thoughts down when I'm typing in this channel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I generally consider myself to be a pretty good writer, but I have difficulty finishing drafts sometimes, and I'm not always good at "just writing" without overediting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;at least when it comes to Blog Posts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;things to be Published&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but I've found that when I'm writing in the context of a chat, or an email, it somehow bypasses the part of my brain that makes "just writing" hard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still edit, sometimes quite extensively (if it's an email)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but the words just flow when I'm staring at a chat box or gmail compose window, instead of a blank text editor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this seems like a super cool hack. I think the writing itself is the most important part, more important than the medium or platform&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so if I write more easily in chat or emails, I should take advantage of that, and allow myself to view this sort of writing as "real" writing, and feel good about it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and if something interesting comes out, I can always package it up into a "proper" blog post if I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;once you have the thoughts in words, however rough, the rest is relatively easy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to write fairly regularly on the CFAR alumni mailing list, and sometimes people would really like something I wrote and urge me to put it up somewhere so they could more easily share it with friends&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;btw, I really like what Joanna has done, publishing pieces of writing just as Facebook posts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that's very much in the same spirit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anyway, inspired by this phenomenon, I registered alicedash.com just now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a place to put my thoughts and writings in a more accessible format, when something interesting comes out of #alice- or similar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and named after this channel, to embody the spirit of ease and informality and flow that I experience here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thank you all for being my little rubber ducks :simple_smile: there's a kind of quiet, passive-listening quality to slack, that makes it really easy to talk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the channel purpose says "Alice talks to herself, and maybe to you!" it really does feel like that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Alice talks to herself"… there's a kind of safe privacy here, like talking to your secret diary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"and maybe to you!"… but a kind of pointfulness and purpose that a diary lacks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anyway, I'd like to have a blog up at alicedash.com by end of Friday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;please do hold me to that :simple_smile&lt;/p&gt;
