    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've picked up a new writing habit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15000 words in last 3 weeks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up super early with my mind excitedly racing; couldn't fall back asleep&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;decided to get up and do something with my energy, after trying unsuccessfully to go back to sleep for an hour&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so, like aray and joannabresee, I have a blogging goal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it super easy to put my thoughts down when I'm typing in this channel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I generally consider myself to be a pretty good writer, but I have difficulty finishing drafts sometimes, and I'm not always good at "just writing" without overediting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;at least when it comes to Blog Posts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;things to be Published&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but I've found that when I'm writing in the context of a chat, or an email, it somehow bypasses the part of my brain that makes "just writing" hard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still edit, sometimes quite extensively (if it's an email)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but the words just flow when I'm staring at a chat box or gmail compose window, instead of a blank text editor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this seems like a super cool hack. I think the writing itself is the most important part, more important than the medium or platform&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so if I write more easily in chat or emails, I should take advantage of that, and allow myself to view this sort of writing as "real" writing, and feel good about it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and if something interesting comes out, I can always package it up into a "proper" blog post if I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;once you have the thoughts in words, however rough, the rest is relatively easy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to write fairly regularly on the CFAR alumni mailing list, and sometimes people would really like something I wrote and urge me to put it up somewhere so they could more easily share it with friends&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;btw, I really like what Joanna has done, publishing pieces of writing just as Facebook posts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that's very much in the same spirit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anyway, inspired by this phenomenon, I registered alicedash.com just now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a place to put my thoughts and writings in a more accessible format, when something interesting comes out of #alice- or similar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and named after this channel, to embody the spirit of ease and informality and flow that I experience here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thank you all for being my little rubber ducks :simple_smile: there's a kind of quiet, passive-listening quality to slack, that makes it really easy to talk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the channel purpose says "Alice talks to herself, and maybe to you!" it really does feel like that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Alice talks to herself"… there's a kind of safe privacy here, like talking to your secret diary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"and maybe to you!"… but a kind of pointfulness and purpose that a diary lacks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anyway, I'd like to have a blog up at alicedash.com by end of Friday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;please do hold me to that :simple_smile&lt;/p&gt;
