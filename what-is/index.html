      <h2>So what is Alice Dash all about?</h2>
      <p>I was thinking a bit today about “what kind of blog” I want Alice Dash to be. I had named it after the #alice- channel I have in my house Slack team, inspired by the sense of ease and informality and flow that I experience when <a href="http://alicedash.com/writers-block-slack/">writing there</a>. I envisioned it as simply a place to put my thoughts and writings in a more accessible format, when something interesting came out of #alice- or someplace similar. I figured I would apply a very light coat of editing (if any) and prioritize being prolific over being "good."</p>

<p>But today, I was thinking of reposting a relationship litmus test that I came up with in #alice-, and part of me was like: "nah, I don’t want this to be a Relationships blog."</p>

<p>But then, another part of me was like: "wait, didn’t you tell yourself that the whole point of Alice Dash was to be a place where you could post ​<strong>anything</strong>​ you were thinking about, without worrying about whether it was 'good' or 'on brand' or thematically related to the other stuff you're posting?"</p>

<p>Didn't you tell yourself that you named it after your Slack channel because you wanted it to be merely a slightly more public version of #alice- itself?</p>

<p>And that if you wanted to be ambitious about some particular piece of content — if you wanted to spend a lot of time editing and thinking about audience and value prop and view counts etc — that you would take that stuff to Medium?</p>

<p>I spent a ​<strong>lot</strong>​ of time working on the writer's block post that I put up yesterday. I knew, partway through, that I was Trying Hard on this one, and not simply doing the thing where I ramble in #alice- and lightly package parts of it for alicedash.com.</p>

<p>And I asked myself why.</p>

<p>And I was like: "I want it to be good! I want to get the blog off to a good start! After that, I can drop the try-harding."</p>

<p>And maybe that's a valid excuse. But I'm also now feeling a sense of: "well, now that I’ve set the bar there, I’ll feel weird posting sloppy stuff."</p>

<p>Or: “People won’t know that this blog is supposed to be just a casual unambitious rambling-ground, and they’ll critique it like it’s a Serious Blog."</p>

<p>Or: “My friends who are savvy about marketing and personal brand will Judge Me."</p>

<p>So I'm following up yesterday's post with this post to address: "what is this blog about, really?"</p>

<p>I'll probably clean up <a href="http://www.yalice.me/">yalice.me</a> at some point and make that my main Personal Brand portal. I could have a section that lists Medium posts as the main attraction that's meant to convey: “read Alice’s brain fruits and be dazzled by them!” And a relatively modest link to alicedash.com, with proper framing around what Alice Dash is, which is probably something like: "This is just an eclectic journal thing. I make no promises about its quality or posting schedule. Feel free to subscribe to it if you just find me to be a personally interesting character for some reason, but I won't try to sell you on that."</p>

<p>I think right now, I should be focusing primarily on just publishing a lot of content. If I want to build audience around a certain topic, I should spin that out as a separate Serious Blog with a mailing list, etc. Like if I wanted to do a blog centered around coding / learning to code, or personal finance for entrepreneurs, or tiny living.</p>

<p>But first, <strong>I should practice posting frequently and without care to Alice Dash.</strong> Separate out the “write and publish prolifically" skill from the “content marketing” skill. Learn to play before learning to work, kill whatever hangups I have that cause me to take forever to publish anything, and let free the prolific writer within.</p>

<p>So that's what Alice Dash is all about. And this post took 40 minutes to edit, compared to 9 hours for yesterday's. Big improvement.</p>
